# Assets Required

The app references some asset files in `app.json`. You'll need to create these:

- `assets/icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `assets/splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `assets/favicon.png` - Web favicon

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares. The app will work without these, but you'll see warnings.

To create placeholder assets quickly, you can use online tools or image editors to create simple colored squares with the app name.
